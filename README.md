This Python script processes well log data and visualizes it using matplotlib. Here's a breakdown of what it does:

    Imports Libraries: It imports necessary libraries such as lasio for reading LAS files, numpy and pandas for data manipulation, and matplotlib.pyplot for plotting.
    Log Mnemonics Dictionary: A dictionary data_dict maps common log mnemonics to lists of possible aliases.
    Function get_best_log: This function retrieves the best available log for a given alias group from the LAS file.
    File Paths: Specifies paths to the LAS file and a CSV file containing formation tops data.
    Load LAS File: Reads the LAS file and extracts the depth index.
    Extract Metadata: Retrieves well name and well number from the LAS file metadata.
    Assign Logs: Dynamically assigns logs for various measurements like gamma ray, resistivity, and porosity using the get_best_log function.
    Load Formation Tops: Reads the formation tops data from the CSV file.
    Plot Setup: Prepares a figure with three subplots for visualizing gamma ray, resistivity, and porosity/PEF logs.
    Plot Gamma Ray Track: Plots the gamma ray log and fills areas based on specific criteria.
    Plot Resistivity Track: Plots deep, medium, and shallow resistivity logs with different styles.
    Plot Porosity & PEF Track: Plots density, neutron, and sonic porosity logs along with the PEF log.
    Overlay Formation Tops: Adds horizontal lines and labels for formation tops if available in the CSV file.
    Finalize Plot: Adjusts layout and shows the plot.

The script is designed to read well log data, process it, and create a detailed visual representation including various logs and formation tops.
